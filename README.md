## Why this exists

This project was built to mirror the firmware architecture used in production UAS and avionics systems — the kind of concept-to-flight ownership that companies like Anduril, Shield AI, and Joby Aviation hire embedded engineers to do. It deliberately avoids reaching for off-the-shelf flight stacks (PX4, ArduPilot, Betaflight) in favor of writing the scheduler, sensor fusion, and control architecture from first principles, because that is where the actual engineering judgment lives.

The companion ground station (HTML/JS GCS with a live mission planning) and the FPGA/SDR telemetry link this firmware is designed to pair with live in separate repos — see [Related work](#related-work).

# Bare-metal STM32H7 Flight Controller

A from-scratch flight controller firmware stack for the STM32H743 — a cooperative SysTick scheduler with hardware-backed fault detection, 9-DOF sensor fusion, and a graceful-degradation flight mode state machine.

## Safety
This is firmware for a system that can spin propellers at lethal speed. Before connecting motors:

- Remove all propellers for every bench test until rate and attitude loops are verified stable.
- Confirm `scheduler_get_stats().missed_deadlines == 0` after a 60-second bench run.
- Verify the watchdog actually resets the MCU within the configured timeout by deliberately hanging a test task.
- Confirm failsafe triggers correctly with the radio link physically disconnected before any flight test.

## Design decisions worth knowing about

**Why a bare-metal scheduler instead of FreeRTOS.** A cooperative SysTick dispatcher gives full control over execution order and eliminates an entire class of priority-inversion and context-switch-jitter bugs that make PID tuning miserable to debug. Every task runs to completion, in a fixed table order, with execution time measured via the DWT cycle counter — you can put an oscilloscope on a single GPIO and see exactly what the CPU is doing at any microsecond. An RTOS earns its complexity when you have many independent, asynchronous workloads; a flight controller's control loops are not that — they are a small number of strictly periodic tasks with hard deadlines, which is exactly what a cooperative scheduler is built for.

**Why the watchdog has two layers, not one.** Every statistic the scheduler tracks (`max_exec_us`, `overruns`) is written *after* a task returns — a task stuck forever in a blocking call or an infinite loop never reaches that code, and the failure is invisible. The IWDG (hardware, LSI-clocked, independent of the CPU core) guarantees recovery no matter what. A second timer, TIM7, runs in one-pulse mode armed fresh before every task call; if it fires, it means that *specific* task exceeded its time budget, and the index is written to an RTC backup register that survives the reset. The result: the next boot can report "task `gps_parse` hung" instead of just resetting with zero diagnostic information.

**Why the flight mode FSM degrades instead of refusing.** If LOITER is requested but GPS lock drops mid-flight, the FSM doesn't get stuck or fault — it walks down a degradation ladder (`LOITER → ALT_HOLD → STABILIZE → FAILSAFE`) until it finds the most capable mode the *currently healthy* sensors can actually support, and sends a status message explaining why. This check runs every tick against the *active* mode, not just at the moment of a mode-change request, because sensors fail mid-flight, not just at the moment a button is pressed.

**Why the rate PID will read raw gyro, not the AHRS output.** (Implemented in the not-yet-written `pid.c`, documented here because it shapes the rest of the design.) The inner control loop needs the lowest possible latency; routing it through a filter — even a fast one — adds phase lag that directly degrades stability margin. Only the D-term gets a light PT1 low-pass, because differentiating raw gyro noise produces spikes a filter has no business being absent for.
